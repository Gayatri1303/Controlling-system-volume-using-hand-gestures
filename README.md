# Controlling-system-volume-using-hand-gestures


This project makes the use of OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to control the system volume based on hand gestures detected from a webcam feed.

The module mediapipe is used to control the hand gestures. Installing this model may create problem in jupyter notebook environment and google collab as well. In that case try VS Code.

This project basically controls the system volume based on the eculedian distance between thumb and pointer finger.
